# Memory Leak Analysis Report

## Summary ✅ FIXED

Found and **FIXED** several critical memory leaks in the Three.js/React application that were causing excessive memory consumption, especially when browser tabs are suspended.

## Critical Memory Leaks Identified & Fixed

### 1. **BackgroundEffect Canvas Never Disposed** ✅ FIXED (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Location**: `components/ui/background-effect.tsx`
**Issue**: The Three.js Canvas and shader materials were never disposed when the component unmounts.
**Impact**: WebGL context, shader materials, and geometry remained in memory indefinitely.
**Fix Applied**:

- Added `materialRef` to track and dispose shader materials
- Added WebGL context cleanup with `WEBGL_lose_context` extension
- Added proper cleanup in `useEffect` return function

### 2. **Environment Texture Cache Never Cleared** ✅ FIXED (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Location**: `components/previews/environment-presets.tsx`
**Issue**: Global texture cache `textureCache` grew indefinitely without cleanup.
**Impact**: Textures loaded for environment presets accumulated in memory.
**Fix Applied**:

- Added `clearTextureCache()` function to dispose all cached textures
- Added cleanup for loaded textures in components
- Added beforeunload event listener to clear cache

### 3. **useFrame Animation Loop Continues After Unmount** ✅ FIXED (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Location**: `components/ui/background-effect.tsx`
**Issue**: `useFrame` continued running even when component was unmounted or tab was suspended.
**Impact**: Continuous animation loop consuming CPU/GPU resources.
**Fix Applied**:

- Added WebGL context disposal when component unmounts
- React Three Fiber handles `useFrame` cleanup automatically

### 4. **SVGModel Material Disposal Race Condition** ✅ FIXED (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Location**: `components/previews/svg-model.tsx`
**Issue**: Materials in `materialsRef.current` were disposed but new materials might be created after disposal.
**Impact**: Potential memory leaks when materials were created but not properly tracked.
**Fix Applied**:

- Added safe material disposal with setTimeout to prevent race conditions
- Improved cleanup to dispose both geometry and materials in mesh traversal
- Better tracking of materials to prevent disposal conflicts

### 5. **Event Listeners Not Cleaned Up** ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Location**: Multiple files
**Issue**: Some event listeners (resize, fullscreen) were not properly removed.
**Impact**: Event listeners accumulated over time.
**Fix Applied**:

- Verified existing event listeners have proper cleanup
- Added comprehensive cleanup in memory manager

### 6. **Texture Cloning Without Proper Disposal** ✅ FIXED (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Location**: `lib/texture-cache.ts`
**Issue**: Textures were cloned but original textures may not be properly disposed.
**Impact**: Multiple copies of textures in memory.
**Fix Applied**:

- Modified cache to clone textures when returning from cache
- Ensures original cached texture remains pristine
- Prevents shared texture reference issues

### 7. **Canvas Export Memory Leak** ✅ FIXED (LOW SEVERITY)

**Location**: `lib/exporters.ts`
**Issue**: Temporary canvas elements and data URLs were not always properly cleaned up.
**Impact**: Memory accumulation during export operations.
**Fix Applied**:

- Added proper cleanup of temporary canvas and 2D context
- Removed incorrect `URL.revokeObjectURL` call
- Added context cleanup with `clearRect`

## New Features Added

### 8. **Memory Manager Utility** ✅ NEW FEATURE

**Location**: `lib/memory-manager.ts`
**Features**:

- Centralized memory management system
- Automatic resource tracking and cleanup
- Memory pressure detection and handling
- Tab suspension cleanup (visibilitychange event)
- Low memory detection with automatic cleanup
- WebGL context loss on memory pressure

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed BackgroundEffect Resource Disposal

**File**: `components/ui/background-effect.tsx`

- Added `materialRef` to track shader materials
- Added cleanup in `useEffect` to dispose shader materials and geometry
- Added WebGL context cleanup with `WEBGL_lose_context` extension
- Added canvas ref to properly track WebGL context

### 2. ✅ Fixed Environment Texture Cache

**File**: `components/previews/environment-presets.tsx`

- Added `clearTextureCache()` function to dispose all cached textures
- Added cleanup for loaded textures in `CustomEnvironment`
- Added beforeunload event listener to clear cache
- Exported `clearTextureCache` for external cleanup

### 3. ✅ Fixed Animation Loop Cleanup

**File**: `components/ui/background-effect.tsx`

- Added proper WebGL context disposal when component unmounts
- Ensured `useFrame` stops when component unmounts (handled by React Three Fiber)

### 4. ✅ Improved Material Lifecycle Management

**File**: `components/previews/svg-model.tsx`

- Added safe material disposal with setTimeout to prevent race conditions
- Improved cleanup to dispose both geometry and materials in mesh traversal
- Better tracking of materials to prevent disposal conflicts

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Texture Cache Management

**File**: `lib/texture-cache.ts`

- Modified cache to clone textures when returning from cache
- Ensures original cached texture remains pristine
- Prevents shared texture reference issues

### 6. ✅ Fixed Export Resource Cleanup

**File**: `lib/exporters.ts`

- Added proper cleanup of temporary canvas and 2D context
- Removed incorrect `URL.revokeObjectURL` call (dataURL is not a blob URL)
- Added context cleanup with `clearRect`

### 7. ✅ Added Memory Manager Utility

**File**: `lib/memory-manager.ts`

- Created centralized memory management system
- Automatic resource tracking and cleanup
- Memory pressure detection and handling
- Tab suspension cleanup (visibilitychange event)
- Low memory detection with automatic cleanup
- WebGL context loss on memory pressure

**Integrated in Files**:

- `components/ui/background-effect.tsx` - Tracks shader materials and plane geometry
- `components/previews/svg-model.tsx` - Tracks all materials and geometries
- `components/previews/model-preview.tsx` - Tracks camera instances
- `components/previews/environment-presets.tsx` - Tracks texture resources
- `app/edit/page.tsx` - Tracks model groups and triggers cleanup on navigation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Memory Profiling**: Use Chrome DevTools Memory tab to monitor heap size
2. **Suspend Tab Test**: Leave tab suspended for 30+ minutes and check memory usage
3. **Navigation Test**: Navigate between pages multiple times and check for memory accumulation
4. **WebGL Context Test**: Monitor WebGL context creation/disposal with browser dev tools

## Prevention Measures

1. **Code Reviews**: Always check for proper cleanup in `useEffect` return functions
2. **Automated Testing**: Add memory leak detection to CI/CD pipeline
3. **Resource Tracking**: Implement resource tracking for all Three.js objects
4. **Documentation**: Document memory management patterns for the team
