A super simple tool to convert your simple SVGs, mostly logos, to 3D models.
Check it out at [https://vecto3d.xyz](https://vecto3d.xyz)

## But why?

So, one day I was bored and decided to open Blender. I loaded up a logo that I designed in Figma (check it out [here](https://x.com/blakssh/status/1895902171788689741)) and then started playing around with the different tools to make it 3D. I knew that you can convert any SVG to 3D models in Blender, but I wanted to make it easier and faster. So I checked out the web and found a few tools, but they were either paid or lacked a 3D model export feature. So I thought, why not make a tool that can do this easily and quickly?

```

## What can you do with this?

- Convert your simple SVGs to 3D models.
- Multiple customization options, which include Geometry, Materials, Environment, and Background, with a simple, intuitive UI.
- Customize your 3D models with your desired thickness or bevels.
- Experiment with different colors and materials (Glass, Metal, Plastic, etc.).
- Preview your 3D models in different environments and also add your own custom environment using any image you want.
- Download 3D models in STL, GLB, and GLTF formats.
- Export images in PNG in HD, 2K, and 4K quality.
- Change the background color of the preview panel to see the 3D model in different colors.

## Vibe Mode

Since vibe coding is currently in trend, I thought, why not add a "vibe mode" to this app? So I added a button to toggle this mode. This mode allows you to add a dreamy effect with bloom and soft shadows to your preview panel.

## Acknowledgements

I've used multiple tools to make this app, especially [V0.dev](https://v0.dev) for quick prototyping, [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/) for the amazing UI components.
